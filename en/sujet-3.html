    <h3>Advanced techniques to improve your website’s SEO</h3>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is essential to maximize the visibility of your website
        on
        search engines.
        While the basic techniques include the use of keywords and the creation of quality content,
        Advanced SEO optimization
        pushes these strategies further by incorporating more sophisticated techniques. These advanced methods allow
        of
        perfect
        every aspect of your website to improve not only its visibility, but also the user experience
        and
        the commitment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Titles and Descriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Page titles and descriptions are essential for SEO. Make sure that every page on your site has
        one
        Unique and eye-catching title
        which includes your main keywords. Descriptions should be informative and invite users to
        click. Use calls
        to action persuasive in descriptions to entice users to visit your site.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good headline must be concise and less than 60 characters to avoid being truncated in the results
        of
        search. Descriptions,
        They should be informative and not exceed 160 characters.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Social Media Tags (Open Graph & Twitter Cards)</h2>
      <p>
        Using the Open Graph and Twitter Cards tags allows you to control how your pages are displayed
        on
        social media.
        This includes defining titles, descriptions and shared images, which can increase the click-through rate
        and the
        sharing your content.
      </p>
      <p>
        These tags help ensure that when your pages are shared on social media, they appear
        of
        professional manner
        and draw the attention of users. For example, the Open Graph tag `og:image` specifies the image to
        use
        when a page is shared
        on Facebook.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Using Strong Words</h2>
      <p>
        Identify and use strong words or long tail keywords in your content. These keywords are
        less
        competitive and attract
        Often more qualified traffic. Integrate them naturally into your titles, subtitles, and content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long-tail keywords are specific and detailed phrases that users are more
        susceptible
        to search. For example,
        instead of "shoes", use "women’s running shoes size 40". This allows you to target an audience
        more
        precise and increases
        conversion chances.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Sitemap XML</h2>
      <p>
        An XML sitemap is crucial to help search engines index all the pages of your site.
        Make sure it is up to date and
        submitted to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools for better indexing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The XML sitemap helps search engine robots find and understand your site structure. It
          must include all pages
          important and update automatically when you add or edit content on your site.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. ALT tags for Images</h2>
      <p>
        ALT tags describe the content of images for search engines and visually impaired users.
        Use descriptions
        and include your keywords when they are relevant. This improves accessibility and can also
        attract
        traffic via search
        of images.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good ALT tag should be descriptive and relevant. For example, instead of "image1.jpg", use
        "shoes
        Women’s Red Running".
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Internal and Ancillary Links</h2>
      <p>
        Internal links help define the structure of your site and distribute authority to pages. Use
        of
        Relevant text anchors
        and make sure that important pages are easily accessible. External links to sites
        high
        quality can also
        Strengthen your credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create internal links that link related pages to improve navigation and help the search engines
        the search for understanding the
        structure of your site. External links to reliable sources add value to your content and
        show the engines of
        Search for a reliable source of your site.

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. URL Structure</h2>
      <p>
        URLs should be simple, descriptive and include relevant keywords. Avoid long and
        complex
        which can be difficult
        to read for users and search engines.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good practice is to use dashes to separate words in the URL, for example,
        "your-site.com/running-shoes" instead
        from "your-site.com/chaussures_de_course".
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Rich Snippets and Structured Data Tags</h2>
      <p>
        Integrating structured data (schema.org) into your HTML code helps search engines
        understand the content of your
        pages. This can improve the way your pages appear in search results with rich
        snippets (ratings, prices,
        events, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Structured data can enrich your search results with additional information,
        increasing your click-through rate.
        For example, product ratings with stars or prizes may prompt users to click
        on
        your results.

        reduction
        of the code and use
        of caching.

      <p>
        Image compression, minification of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and use of caching
        of
        browser are
        common practices to improve page loading speed. A faster site improves the experience
        user and can also
        reduce bounce rates.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>

      <p>
        With mobile search increasing, it is essential that your site be fully
        responsive. Use techniques
        such as responsive design and Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to ensure a user experience
        fluid
        on all devices.

          Make sure your site is easy to navigate on small screens and that loading times are
          fast
          on mobile devices.
          Google uses mobile-first indexing, which means that the mobile version of your site is considered
          as
          main for the
          classification.

        the
        bounce rate, and the
        time spent on site to make informed decisions about adjustments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12. Long and Formatted Content</h2>
      <p> Long and well-structured content is appreciated by search engines. Use subtitles (H2, H3,
        etc.), bulleted lists and short paragraphs to improve readability. Longer content allows
        also to cover topics in depth, which can attract more inbound links. </p>
      <p> Ensure that each content section is clear, concise and provides real value
        to

        pages
        related.
      </p>

        For example, instead of using "click here", use "learn more about SEO optimization" to create a
        link
        to a relevant page.
